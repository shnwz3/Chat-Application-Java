<h1>Chat Application</h1>
<p>
  The provided code represents the foundation for a "simple Chat Application" 
in Java using the *Swing framework*. The project aims to create a basic chat application with a Graphical User Interface(GUI) .
This application begins with a secure *Login screen*, where users must enter their username and password. After successful authentication, users can choose between 
"Personal Chat" and "Group Chat" options. 
"Personal Chat" facilitates one on one conversations, while 
"Group Chat" allows users to specify the number of friends they want to include in a group chat. This choice facilitates both private and group communication.
	
This code serves as a starting point for a simple chat application and can be extended and enhanced to meet more advanced requirements.
